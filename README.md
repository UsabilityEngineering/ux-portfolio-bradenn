# UX Portfolio

My name is Braden Nicholson. I am studying computer science at Chico State. I've worked on quite a few UI/UX projects
over the years, mostly outside of my college education. Some of the more major ones
are [udap](https://github.com/bradenn/udap), [netwatcher](https://github.com/netwatcherio), [monoverse](https://github.com/bradenn/monoverse),
and [turnin](https://github.com/bradenn/turnin-client) to name a few. More projects can be found on my
website [https://www.bradenn.com](https://www.bradenn.com)
